# Single Price Grid Component
Single price grid component created by me using HTML &amp; CSS.

After coming across a design on Figma, I made the decision to recreate it using my own HTML and CSS code. In order to achieve the desired layout, I utilized both flexbox and grid.

Through careful attention to detail, I was able to create a fully responsive webpage that is both user-friendly and interactive. Overall, I am very satisfied with the final product and feel that this project has helped me to strengthen my coding skills.
